                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        My project will be a website aggregator that will display the schedule, news, and race data
                        related to Formula 1 (F1) in a single webpage with interactive components.<br />
                        The name of the project that I have chosen is F1Dash. It is a play on the word “dash” which
                        means to be in a hurry (something you want to be as a driver in F1) as well as a shortened
                        version of the word dashboard.<br />
                        The interactive components will allow a user to customise the data visualizations which can be
                        used for analytics and comparison.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Motivation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Globally, the average audience per Grand Prix in 2021 was 70.3m so there is a large market for an application that aggregates F1 news coupled with an interactive statistics component. <br/>
                        I enjoy following F1 and the goal of this project is to display the latest information in one easily accessible place using open-source UI components and visualization libraries to make the application look modern and easy to use. <br/>
                        This project is interesting to me because it gives me the opportunity to learn the development skills required to design and build an application that is hosted in the cloud from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>Automatically updated – The sources and data that will be displayed on the app needs to be
                        automatically updated to show the latest information. To achieve this, an automated backend
                        service will need to be built that will query online sources for news, videos, schedules, and
                        statistics. Due to the large range of sources available and the time constraint of releasing the
                        application, the project will initially integrate with publicly available APIs to gather data.
                        Web scraping is another option to retrieve data although this option will remain as a potential
                        future addition for the scope of this project.</p>
                    <p>Always Online – In order to serve the application 24/7, it will be hosted on a server using a
                        cloud services platform (AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, Oracle Cloud). Further research will need to
                        be done when selecting which cloud platform due to the current unknown data storage and transfer
                        requirements required for the calculation of costs although the services provided by each of
                        cloud providers are similar enough to be confident that this decision can be made at a later
                        date.</p>
                    <p>Accessible anywhere – By having the application available online, this allows the opportunity to
                        have it accessible across both desktop and mobile platforms. The application front-end will be
                        designed to be mobile friendly although a native client for mobile will not be developed at this
                        point. If the application concept proves to be successful then a native client can be
                        considered.</p>
                    <p>Statistics Analysis – Interactive visualisation of F1 statistics is the main feature of this
                        application. It will allow a user to apply filters to display historical and live F1 race timing
                        and telemetry data. This will allow a user to get a better insight into F1 races and be able to
                        use the visualised data to easily form data-backed opinions. </p>
                    <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
                    <p>A cloud platform will be used to create and host a Linux virtual server which will be the host of
                        the web application. There are a range of available Linux distributions that would be applicable
                        but I will most likely use Ubuntu Server because of the available documentation.</p>
                    <p>A database is required to store the data that is fetched from the public APIs. An initial mock-up
                        of the project will be created with an SQL database like <a
                            href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or <a
                            href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and the performance of the database can be
                        evaluated. A NoSQL database can be reviewed if the SQL databases are not performing as expected
                        although this is not expected to be of concern.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web Server – Apache Tomcat which comes pre-packaged in with Java Spring
                        </li>

                        <li>Web Application Framework – Java Spring RESTful web service to serve the API for the clients
                            to consume data.</li>

                        <li>Front-end Framework – HTML, CSS, JavaScript languages to develop using the React front-end
                            framework</li>

                        <li>Text editor – Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEA for coding, debugging, and packaging the
                            applications.</li>

                        <li>Internet browser – Mozilla Firefox/Google Chrome web browser to test, debug, and run the
                            application.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Skills Required</h4>
                    <p>The skills required will predominantly be software programming based because the architecture of
                        the application will be cloud based and the data is retrieved through online sources. The skills
                        required to complete this project covers the knowledge of full-stack development of an
                        application: from the backend services that gathers data, web services that serve the data, and
                        frontend clients that display the data. </p>
                    <p>More specifically, knowledge in:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cloud virtual server instantiation and administration</li>
                        <li>Ubuntu Server systems administration</li>
                        <li>Java, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript programming</li>
                        <li>HTTP and RESTful web services</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The documentation of open-source software and tools would be the best place to gain the skills
                        required to complete this project. Also, discussions boards like <a
                            href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> or <a
                            href="https://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> can have the answers to common issues
                        or problems that have been experienced by others.</p>
                    <h4>Outcome</h4>
                    <p>If this project were to be successful, it would provide a single accessible dashboard of
                        information, entertainment, and knowledge of F1 news, media, and statistics for a user. It will
                        eliminate having to open multiple websites by providing a single place for F1 news while also
                        providing useful tools to analyse F1 data. I don’t imagine the impact to be world changing. It
                        will be another source of entertainment that makes life just that little bit easier for anyone
                        who enjoys following F1. </p>
                    <p>The impact it would have on me personally would be greater. I would have learnt the skills
                        required to successfully design and build an application that can manipulate and display data
                        obtained from multiple online sources. </p>
