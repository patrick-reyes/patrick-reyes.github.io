                    <h3>What is your interest in IT? </h3>
                    <p>I am interested in software development and learning how to architect software solutions. I feel like I
                        have patches of basic knowledge in the area which I learned through self-study and work but I want to
                        have a more rounded, current, higher-level understanding of the full process from design, development
                        and deployment (SDLC comes to mind, something we did not really practice at work). </p>
                    <h3>When did your interest start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked you interest?</h3>
                    <p>My interest in IT has gone through a lot of changes and phases throughout my life. My father graduated
                        with a degree in Civil Engineering in the Philippines but when he migrated to Australia his first job
                        was in the IT field as a programmer. He had a PC at home that ran DOS which he used for study. He also
                        had some games on floppy discs which he taught me how to run and play. This would be how I first learnt
                        how to navigate the filesystem of a computer with the command line and using simple commands like CD to
                        change directory or DIR /P to list a directory with a lot of files and subdirectories and looking for
                        files that ended in .EXE to identify them as the ones I needed to run to start the games/applications.
                        These early experiences with computers are what I attribute to initially forming my interests in
                        technology.</p>
                    <h3>Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
                    <p>Since completing my Certificate III in IT Networking I have held a range of roles (on and off over the
                        years) in the IT support field with a Managed Services Provider, Fashion Retail businesses, and most
                        recently a small software integration company. The majority of my experience is with smaller IT systems
                        and I aspire to work towards getting experience with working on larger scale systems, more specifically
                        with cloud solutions.
                    <h3>What makes IT interesting for you? </h3>
                    <h3>What lead you to study at RMIT? </h3>
                    <p>I chose to study at RMIT because I found that it is possible to complete a Bachelor level education going
                        through Open Universities Australia and studying online. I did not achieve to my fullest potential in
                        high school and studying online through RMIT has given me the opportunity to get a formal education and
                        obtain a degree without previous academic merit normally required for entry at other institutions.</p>
                    <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
                    <p>While studying at RMIT, I expect to learn the foundations of IT and cover any gaps in knowledge that I
                        may have missed from self-study. I also expect to learn current technologies as well as frameworks that
                        cover aspects of IT (project management, software development life cycle) that I can bring with me to
                        potential future employers when I start looking for a job that is more aligned with my goals and build
                        on the skills I learn. </p>
                    <h3>What do you hope to do after graduation?</h3>
                    <p>After graduation, I want to apply the skills and knowledge I have learnt to create or contribute to
                        something that has a positive impact on society. I hope to gain employment with a company that utilizes
                        the latest technologies and frameworks to successfully provide services and products at scale.</p>
