                        Description of the position and what makes this position appealing to you.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The job advertisement I have selected is for a software engineering role in a technology
                        consulting company. <br />
                        The position appeals to me because of the range of technology the job advertisement claims the
                        firm focuses on: Data & Analytics, Digital, Cloud & Technology, Customer Engagement, Artificial
                        Intelligence and Cyber Security. These areas overlap a lot of my interests in Information
                        Technology and I would like to work towards becoming a software developer with the skills to
                        work in one or more of these areas.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The position is looking to hire someone with the ability to develop software and apps (primarily
                        data or automation solutions) using a range of programming languages that would be deployed on
                        cloud infrastructure. The software teams follow software development frameworks and
                        methodologies such as (but not limited to) Continuous Integration/Continuous Development, Test
                        Driven Development and secure coding practices so experience working with these frameworks and
                        methodologies would be required. <br />
                        Strong communication skills to manage stakeholders, share information and processes with team
                        members, and to work in an agile environment is also required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The job advertisement does not explicitly state required qualifications but I would expect a
                        Bachelor Degree in Software Engineering, Computer Science and certifications in cloud technologies
                        and to be beneficial.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The Certificate III in Information Technology (Networking) has given me a good foundation on
                        networking principles but I do not believe this is enough for the role and only slightly
                        relevant.<br/>
                        The languages I have used are C# (.NET Framework/Core) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The applications
                        were deployed and hosted on Windows servers using Microsoft IIS. These skills were either
                        self-taught or informally through work by performing my own research as required or liaising
                        with colleagues for escalation.<br/>
                        My experience with programming in a few languages to support, maintain, and update desktop and
                        web-based applications would be relevant to the requirement of skills with a range of
                        programming languages although because the apps were hosted on on-premises servers that operated
                        within a private windows-centric infrastructure, I am unable to demonstrate extensive experience
                        with working in cloud environments. I am also not confident in demonstrating knowledge of data
                        structures and algorithmic solutions.<br/>
                        Working with small teams in a range of roles from IT Helpdesk to Application Support required
                        professional communication and time management skills.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the
                        position</h4>
                    <p>
                        Completing the Bachelors of IT will get me started with solidifying my foundational knowledge of
                        Information Technology with a potential to transfer to a more suitable degree like Bachelors of
                        Software Engineering or Bachelor of Computer Science which is more aligned with my interests.
                        Furthermore, I will look towards completing certifications in frameworks, methodologies or
                        subject matters that are focused on software development in the areas of security, cloud
                        environments and data management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the meantime, I will also work towards finding employment with a business that utilizes the
                        technology that I am interested in and has roles available that are suited to my abilities,
                        experience, and qualifications.
